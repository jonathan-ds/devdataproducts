## Through the might of this single plot.  All this can be yours.
```{r simple-plot, fig.height = 6, fig.align = 'center', message = F,warning = F}
require(ggplot2)
library(UsingR)
data(galton)
myfit <- lm(child ~parent, data=galton)
qplot(child,parent,data=galton)+geom_abline(intercept=myfit$coefficients[1],slope=myfit$coefficients[2])
```

## Conclusion

* Applications like this provide information which allow parents to maintain their illusion of control.
* The NBA could really use another Chuck Nevitt
* There is nothing cooler than Peter Dinklage throwing up the horns.
